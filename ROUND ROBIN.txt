AIM: To simulate the CPU scheduling algorithm round-robin.


DESCRIPTION:
To aim is to calculate the average waiting time. There will be a time slice, each
process should be executed within that time-slice and if not it will go to the waiting
state so first check whether the burst time is less than the time-slice. If it is less than it assign the waiting time to the sum of the total times. If it is greater than the burst-time then subtract the time slot from the actual burst time and increment it by time-slot and the loop continues until all the processes are completed.


ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Start the process

Step 2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue and time quantum (or) time
slice

Step 3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst
time

Step 4: Calculate the no. of time slices for each process where No. of time
slice for process (n) = burst time process (n)/time slice

Step 5: If the burst time is less than the time slice then the no. of time slices =1.

Step 6: Consider the ready queue is a circular Q, calculate
a) Waiting time for process (n) = waiting time of process(n-1)+ burst time of
process(n-1 ) + the time difference in getting the CPU fromprocess(n-1)
b) Turnaround time for process(n) = waiting time of process(n) + burst time of
process(n)+ the time difference in getting CPU from process(n).

Step 7: Calculate
c) Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process
d) Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number ofprocess Step

8: Stop the process
