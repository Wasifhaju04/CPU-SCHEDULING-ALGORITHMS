AIM: To write a program to stimulate the CPU scheduling algorithm Shortest job first
(Non- Preemption)


DESCRIPTION:
To calculate the average waiting time in the shortest job first algorithm the sorting of
the process based on their burst time in ascending order then calculate the waiting time of each process as the sum of the bursting times of all the process previous or before to that process.


ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Start the process

Step 2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue

Step 3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU
burst time

Step 4: Start the Ready Q according the shortest Burst time by sorting according to
lowest to highest burst time.

Step 5: Set the waiting time of the first process as ‗0‘ and its turnaround time as its burst time.

Step 6: Sort the processes names based on their Burst time

Step 7: For each process in the ready queue, calculate
a) Waiting time(n)= waiting time (n-1) + Burst time (n-1)
b) Turnaround time (n)= waiting time(n)+Burst time(n)

Step 8: Calculate
c) Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process
d)Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process

Step 9: Stop the process
